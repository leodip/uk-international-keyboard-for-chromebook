# UK International keyboard for Chromebook (with dead keys)

I wrote this extension to allow the use of accents (or diacritical marks) when using a UK keyboard in Chromebook. For example:

á é ã ç à ü ê

It targets the Brazilian Portuguese language, but you can change it in the source and allow it on any language.

I've tested it on Lenovo N22.

Steps to use:

1) Copy the files to a folder in your Chromebook

2) Go to chrome://extensions in your browser

3) Make sure to check the box 'Developer mode' in the top-right

4) Click 'Load unpacked extension...' and select the folder from step 1

5) Go to chrome://settings/languages and add the language (in this case, Portuguese from Brazil) and choose the UK International keyboard

6) If you look in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen you'll see an indicator noting which keyboard you're using. You can switch to UK International there

Happy writing-with-accents :-)
